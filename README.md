# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

My note:

In this project, the guideline was to produce an efficient code that would allow reuse in case of changing or adding data in the future.

For that cause I used one loop that calls all sections,

I tried to maintain correct labeling and tagging in order to make the site accessible,

I used css variables that would allow style changes, quickly and efficiently if necessary,

I created "dum" template components that receive information from a higher component and display the information with as little code as possible.
